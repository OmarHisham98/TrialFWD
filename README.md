# TrialFWD
For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert", meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal was to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

**The Goals are:**
use A/B hypothesis testing in python to help company find out whether the new website landing page has higher usersâ€™ conversion rate than old page using Pandas and Matplotlib.

perform regression analysis using two method -- Using loop to similate 10,000 experiment using numpy.random.choice() function and another method is to use StatsModel package to run logistic regression model.

merge another dataset and measure effect of country factor using sklearn and interpret results with practical reasoning
